Asalaamu 'alaykum!

We are group 'Yusra's Champions (Junaid is okay... I guess)' and these are our answers to your questions. 

The General Python questions (Q1 - Q15) have been answered in separate python files, with a main() function that prints the solution. Simply run each file and the solution should be printed. 

The Pandas questions have been answered in a single python file called PythonQuestions.py. This file does not have a main() function,so you will need to uncomment the print statements written after each function and run the code.

There is also a little fun at the end of each file to make marking this a little more worthwile. 

Enjoy :)
